# Global Tech Worker Demographics Analysis Project

## Overview
This Python project is dedicated to understanding the demographics of tech workers across 54 countries, aiming to provide valuable insights into the variations observed. The analysis focuses on key attributes such as countries, states, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). By examining these variables, the project seeks to gain a comprehensive understanding of the global landscape of tech workers and identify trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions within the industry.

## Deployment
The project includes a Streamlit web application that visualizes the insights derived from the analysis. The deployed application can be accessed at [Tech Dashboard](https://tech-dashboard.streamlit.app/). It provides an interactive interface for users to explore the demographic trends of tech workers across different countries and gain valuable insights into the geographic distribution of the tech workforce.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered datasets containing information on tech worker demographics, including countries, states, and geographical coordinates, from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency in formatting.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of tech workers across different countries and states, as well as their geographic distribution based on latitude and longitude.
4. **Geospatial Visualization**: Utilized geospatial visualization techniques to plot the geographic distribution of tech workers on interactive maps, providing insights into the global landscape of the tech industry.
